    Bruno Rezende is teh setter for Brazil and an insanely talanted player
</p>

</p>
Dmitry Volkov is the opposite hitter for a club team in Russia called Zenit-Kazan.
</p> <img src="Volkov.jpg" width="250" length="250" alt="">
He's a scary player to go up against since not only is he good at spiking but he also has a crazy block <img src="Volkov Block.jpg" width="250" length="20" alt=""> <img src="Volkov.jpg" width="250" length="250" alt="">
