  The best and my favorite national team is the Japanese national team.
</p>
 The Japanese team was the first team I ever watched and I've been watching the since
</p>
The first match specifically was the Japan vs Brazil VNL 2023 game
</p>
    

      <p>They have the best roster </p>
      Masahiro Sekita the setter. Hes 5'9 and typically short for a volleyball player. Masahiro almost never makes any mistakes and is very dependable
    </p>
    Hes shorter than even the average libero. <img src="Sekita.jfif" width="200"length=200 alt=""> <img src="Setting.jpg" width="300" length="300" alt="">
    </p>
Yuji Nishida is the opposite for Japan. He's left handed and is also shorter than the average opposite
  </p>
  He has a amazingly quick swing and is a server you hate trying to dig. <img src="Yuji Nishida.jpg" width="250"length="250" alt=""> <img src="138.jpg" width="300" length="300" alt="">
</p>
Next is one of the best liberos in the world and got the MVP award for the 2024 VNL, Tomohiro Yamamoto <img src="Yama.jpg" width="300" length="300" alt="">
</p>
He is a huge influnce for me and a great inspiration for me. <img src="Tomo.jfif" width="250" length="250" alt="">
</p>
Ran Takahashi is a opposite hitter for Japan and he is still really young and has a lot to learn
</p>
He also typically shorter than the average player but still claimed his spot on the team. <img src="012724 ran takahashi.jpg" width="250" length="250" alt="">
</p>
Taishi Onodera is one of the many middle blockers in japan and stands 6'8.
</p>
He is a formidable wall and also an olympian <img src="Onodera.jfif" width="200" length="200" alt="">
</p>
Finally is Yuki Ishikawa the opposite hitter for Japan. Ishikawa is a veteran in the sport and a scary opponent
</p>
Yuki is a very crafty and creative hitter like Ran Takahashi but has more experience than him <img src="Fake set.jfif" width="250"length="250" alt="">
